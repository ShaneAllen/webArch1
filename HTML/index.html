		The dummy copy at this site is made from a dictionary of 500 words 			from Cicero's original source and the text fragments traditionally 			added. We use a lexical scheme to ensure a grammatically correct look 			and feel. This avoids repetitions, unintentional humor, and 			structures considered non-idiomatic for standard lipsum filler text. 			This generator doesn't just add chunks of predefined text with a 			limited choice of words.
